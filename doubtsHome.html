                            <p>How do I find the derivative of a complex function?</p>
                            <span class="subject-tag">Mathematics</span>
                        </div>
                        <div class="doubt-answer">
                            <p>To find the derivative of a complex function, you need to apply the chain rule, product rule, or quotient rule as necessary, breaking down the function into simpler parts and differentiating each part accordingly.</p>

                            <p>A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, whereas a queue follows the First In, First Out (FIFO) principle. This means in a stack, the last element added is the first one to be removed, while in a queue, the first element added is the first one to be removed.</p>

                            <p>The theory of relativity, proposed by Albert Einstein, has two main parts: Special Relativity and General Relativity. Special Relativity deals with objects moving at constant speeds, stating that time and space are relative and can change depending on the observer's speed. General Relativity explains gravity as the warping of space-time by mass.</p>

                            <p>To implement responsive design, use CSS media queries to apply different styles based on the device's screen size. Additionally, consider using flexible grid layouts, responsive images, and a mobile-first approach to ensure your website looks good on all devices.</p>
